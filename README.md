# assignment-2-chat-room-namespaces
I have created a namespace Tech which contains 3 rooms:
1- javacript
2- Swift
3- Css

-Everytime a user joins a room , every user of that room gets a notification that a "new user has joined the room"

-Chat belonging to a particular room can be seen by users inside that room only.
